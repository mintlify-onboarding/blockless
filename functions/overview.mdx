Blockless Functions is a decentralized and verifiable serverless platform that lets you run code for any types of application and backend service in response to on-chain and cloud events. With Blockless Functions, you no longer need to provision and manage servers or node networks, saving you time and resources.


## Security & Scalability

Blockless Functions platform is built on top of the Blockless Protocol with security and scalability in mind. As a result, the platform offers high availability and reliability for your growing demand and usage.


## Service Oriented

The Blockless Functions platform integrates seamlessly with many services and extensions, such as blockchain RPCs, decentralized data oracle, data caching, and etc., providing a flexible and cost-effective way to build and deploy decentralized applications.


## Initial Node Offerings

Functions can be deployed to a targeted group of nodes with specific features (such as a specific NFT ownership). This allows you to assemble a function-specific subnetwork or shard. The subnetwork can also be dynamically load-balanced with varying incoming load.
